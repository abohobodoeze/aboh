        Iwelles agreed with I'll intension. By the time of crossing the Iwelles found it possible to kill some of the
        Benin immigrants as the Iwelles understood that the immigrants did not know how to swim. After the immigrants
        have embarked on the canoe the Iwelles pull out into the midstream and say to themselves "GBAMI YIOKO" meaning

        met the Akarai people at the southern end of the present Aboh. After a while the two groups began to struggle
        for leadership which resulted to war . The war was in favour of the Benins. Akarai group packed out. Some went
        Northward of the Niger and planted Akarai ogidi while others went into the bush South of Aboh town. Later both
        groups settled their differences and Akarai group had a representative in the Aboh palace known as "Oghene".

      Obazome gave the eldest Akara (Okpalauku) the right in the palace not to kneel down when greeting the OBI of

      <p></p> the settlement with Akarai people, the Benins decided to revenge what the Iwelles did to them when they
      were crossing them over to the Eastern side of the Ase creek. The Benins got to then place and declared war
